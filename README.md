ArrayLibrary and ReviewAnalysis Project

Overview

ArrayLibrary Implementation

I have implemented the methods prototyped and described in ArrayLibrary.java. To test my code, I used the JUnit tests provided in ArrayLibraryTest.java. I also added my own tests to ensure the correctness of my solutions. Although my tests are not graded, they helped me verify that my solutions meet the specifications. The provided JUnit tests serve as a baseline for expected behavior but are not a complete match to the specification.

Important: I did not include output code in any methods except for the main method.

Part 2: ReviewAnalysis Program

I wrote a program to analyze movie reviews as described in ReviewAnalysis.java. This file contains an implemented main method that drives the overall program. The provided code calls methods that needed to be implemented. A basic set of JUnit tests is included to demonstrate the behavior for simple cases. Understanding the expected behavior of these methods is more complex than earlier tasks. I reviewed the JUnit cases to help understand what the methods are supposed to do.

This program is more complicated than previous assignments. I took the time to understand the overall goal by reviewing the Friday slides and examining how the methods work together to solve the problem. I identified the methods that needed implementation and their purposes, leveraging some methods to assist in implementing others. The test cases were useful in confirming that I was on the right track. I also asked questions when needed.

After completing the program and running it, I examined the output where it predicts the score a review should get and compares it to the actual score.

Analysis

Upon reviewing the program's output, I wrote a paragraph describing my observations. I considered how well the prediction performed and looked for any trends in the predictions. I aimed to explain the observed behavior based on the output, ensuring that my discussion was focused and meaningful.

How to Run
ArrayLibrary:

Implement the methods in ArrayLibrary.java.
Run the JUnit tests in ArrayLibraryTest.java to test the implementation.
Optionally, add more tests or call functions from the main method for additional testing.

ReviewAnalysis:

Implement the methods in ReviewAnalysis.java.
Use the provided main method to drive the program.
Run the basic JUnit tests to understand the expected behavior.
Analyze the program's output after running it, focusing on the prediction accuracy and trends.

Conclusion

This project required a deep understanding of method implementation and testing, particularly for the more complex ReviewAnalysis program. Through careful examination and testing, I ensured that my solutions met the required specifications and provided meaningful insights into the program's performance.
